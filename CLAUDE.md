## Development Workflow
- After each bug fix or feature implementation, update the version of the tool, commit, and push to GitHub

## Build Considerations
- Always build a static portable version to avoid library compatibility issues (e.g., GLIBC version mismatches)
- Ensure the binary can run on different Linux distributions without dependency problems
