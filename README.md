## Installation

```bash
# Install to system (installs Go version as default)
make install

# Manual installation
sudo cp bin/jmux-go /usr/local/bin/jmux      # Go version (recommended)
sudo cp bin/jmux /usr/local/bin/jmux-bash    # Bash version  
sudo cp bin/jcat-binary /usr/local/bin/jcat  # jcat binary
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup NFS Mount (Required)

First, mount the shared storage required for jmux:

```bash
# Check current mount status
sudo ./mount-projects-common.sh status

# Mount the NFS share
sudo ./mount-projects-common.sh mount

# Setup autofs for automatic mounting (recommended)
sudo ./mount-projects-common.sh autofs
```

### 2. Basic Usage

```bash
# Start regular tmux session (registers your IP)
./jmux

# Share your current/new session
./jmux share

# Join someone's shared session
./jmux join username
```

## Advanced Features

### Named Sessions
```bash
# Create session with custom name
./jmux share --name "code-review" alice bob
```

### Multiple Invitees
```bash
# Invite multiple users
./jmux share alice bob charlie dave
```

### Private Sessions
```bash
# Create private session (only invited users can join)
./jmux share --private alice bob
```

### Real-Time Messaging
```bash
# Send a regular message
./jmux msg alice "Can you help me with the deployment?"

# Send an urgent message (high priority)
./jmux msg bob urgent "Server is down!"

# Manage message watcher
./jmux watch status
./jmux watch start
./jmux watch stop
./jmux watch restart
```

#### Message Features:
- **📨 Instant delivery**: Messages appear immediately at bottom of terminal
- **🎨 Visual indicators**: Different icons for invites, urgent messages, etc.
- **⏰ Auto-hide**: Messages disappear after configurable duration
- **🔧 Non-intrusive**: Doesn't disrupt current work, saves cursor position
- **⚙️ Configurable**: Control display duration and enable/disable real-time

### Flexible Joining Options
```bash
# Join by username
./jmux join alice

# Join specific session by username  
./jmux join dory mysession

# Join by IP address (default port)
./jmux join 192.168.1.100

# Join by IP with specific port
./jmux join 192.168.1.100 12346

# Join by hostname
./jmux join server.example.com

# Join by hostname with port
./jmux join server.example.com 54321

# Auto-join from pending invitation
./jmux join
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `jmux` | Start regular tmux session |
| `jmux share [options] [users...]` | Share session with options |
| `jmux join [user\|hostname\|ip] [session-name\|port]` | Join a shared session |
| `jmux stop` | Stop sharing current session |
| `jmux status` | Show detailed status |
| `jmux sessions` | List all active shared sessions |
| `jmux users` | List connected users in current session |
| `jmux list-users` | List all registered users |
| `jmux messages` | Check for new messages |

## Share Options

- `--name <name>`: Set custom session name
- `--private`: Make session private (only invited users can join)
- `[users...]`: Space-separated list of users to invite

## Status Display

When sharing a session, the tmux footer displays:
```
[SHARED] Join: jmux join username | Connections: 2
```

- Updates every 30 seconds
- Shows exact join command for others
- Displays current connection count
- Automatically clears when sharing stops

## Setup Requirements

### Dependencies
```bash
# Required: socat and NFS tools
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install socat nfs-common autofs inotify-tools

# RHEL/CentOS/Fedora
sudo yum install socat nfs-utils autofs inotify-tools

# Note: tmux auto-installs if missing (downloads AppImage)
# Note: inotify-tools is optional for real-time messaging
# Without it, messaging works with manual checking
```

### NFS Mount
The `/projects/common` NFS share must be mounted for shared storage:
- Server: `x-filer21-100.xsight.ent:/project_common`
- Mount point: `/projects/common`
- User ID: `87002638`, Group ID: `87001524`
- Use the provided `mount-projects-common.sh` script

### Environment Variables
```bash
export JMUX_PORT=12345                                    # Port for sharing
export JMUX_SHARED_DIR=/projects/common/work/dory/jmux    # Shared storage path
export JMUX_REALTIME=true                                 # Enable real-time messaging
export JMUX_NOTIFICATION_DURATION=5                       # Message display duration (seconds)
```

└── sessions/         # Active session registry
```

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify functionality:
```bash
./test_jmux.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Shared storage not accessible"**
   - Ensure `/projects/common` is mounted
   - Run: `sudo ./mount-projects-common.sh status`

2. **"Port already in use"**
   - jmux will automatically find available ports
   - Set custom port: `export JMUX_PORT=54321`

3. **"User not found"**
   - Users must run `jmux` at least once to register
   - Check registered users: `jmux list-users`

4. **Permission issues**
   - Ensure write access to `$JMUX_SHARED_DIR/jmux/`
   - Check NFS mount permissions

5. **Terminal broken after session (mouse sends keystrokes)**
   - Run: `jmux reset`
   - Or manually: `stty sane && reset`
   - This fixes terminal state corruption from socat connections

6. **Real-time messages not working**
   - Install inotify-tools: `sudo apt-get install inotify-tools`
   - Check watcher status: `jmux watch status`
   - Restart watcher: `jmux watch restart`
   - Disable if needed: `export JMUX_REALTIME=false`

7. **Messages appearing in wrong location**
   - Terminal may not support cursor save/restore
   - Try resizing terminal or using different terminal emulator
   - Check `$TERM` environment variable

### Debug Mode
Enable debug output:
```bash
set -x
./jmux share alice
```

## Security Notes

- Sessions are shared over unencrypted connections
- Private sessions restrict access but don't encrypt data
- Use only on trusted networks
- Regular cleanup of old session files recommended

# TODO: 
[ ]   need to validate the join-session permissions, how is it handled?
[ ]   add security (password / encryption / pem etc)
[ ]   use different version of socat to allow sigwitch? https://github.com/StalkR/misc/tree/master/pty
[ ]   add "ask for share" that is doing reverse sharing
[ ]   live monitor without inotify
[ ]   every share should also show (print to the host/listener session) the share command that the client should run to connect (if there are more than one sessions, the session name is preferred to be shown)
      if not using a shared directory - you should display the full ip:port in your join command.
[ ]   add request-for-share command which will start a reverse port listen so that if a client connects to that port, the client will share his session. jcat should be enhanced for this
[ ]   Modes:
         Assistant mode (now)
         View only mode
         Pair programming mode
[ ]   Both host and client should be able to bring up a menu that only they can see.
[ ]   Add ability to Switch modes
[ ]   host commands: kick / Ban user
[ ]   client commands: leave / switch to another remote-session / rename
[ ]   Secure connection: Password / ssl key / encryption

[ ] Go over all tests and fix them
[ ] Create regression file to run all tests. whenever there's a new test add it to regression
[ ] Validate password
[ ] Validate client+host menu and security
[ ] Validate kick / invite / leave
[ ] Validate rogue mode
[ ] Validate encryption pass
[ ] Validate - jcat/dmux should also support reverse for client. when client is running dmux ask-share [users] client is starting to listen for connection. host is getting notification message and when host is connecting to the client then sharing its session.
[ ] msg monitoring does not work on nfs
[ ] Validate sigswitch on start?
[ ] Debug invite messages propagation?
[ ] join-share spaces fix 
[ ] Validate reverse join-share from tmux and from terminal
[ ] Add 'dmux stop all'

when host detach the sharing is done - why?
if running share with name but the session name exists. if this session is not in share make it share. if no name was given a new session should be created
if there are more than one ips, write them all in the sessions file so that connecting clients will try one by one

printf '\e[?1000l\e[?1002l\e[?1003l\e[?1006l'
or reset

bugs:
- dmux status can show messages that dmux messages doesn't
- 'dmux share' from a session should use the current session name.
- cleanup can't remove stale sessions of other users
- cleanup should not close sessions that are running in the background and are in the sessions db file
- dmux monitor stopped working. need to check
